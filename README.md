<p data-start="2385" data-end="2555"><strong data-start="2385" data-end="2395">Timing</strong>: Most pre-workouts should be consumed 20&ndash;45 minutes before starting a workout. This allows enough time for the ingredients to be absorbed into the bloodstream.</p>
</li>

<h2 data-start="6803" data-end="6838">Daily Use and Long-Term Strategy</h2>
<p data-start="6840" data-end="7050">While pre-workouts can be effective tools, they shouldn&rsquo;t become a crutch. Relying on them daily can lead to tolerance build-up, requiring larger doses for the same effect. For a sustainable long-term strategy:</p>
<ol data-start="7052" data-end="7514">

<p data-start="8110" data-end="8270"><strong data-start="8110" data-end="8155">Q4: Can I mix pre-workouts with creatine?</strong><br data-start="8155" data-end="8158" /> Yes. Many pre-workouts already contain creatine, but if yours doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s safe and often beneficial to add it.</p>
